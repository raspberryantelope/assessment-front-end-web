    <p>My name is Alex. I'm 24 years old and currently studying Cybersecurity. I love the outdoors (camping, hiking, backpacking, etc.), making (and listening to!) music, video games, spending time with friends, and learning.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Computers</li>
                Through both heavy self-learning and years of IT employment, I have an exceptional understand of the functionality of computers, as well as their hardware. This makes it much easier to learn new programs or processes when necessary.
                <li>Customer Service + Technical Support</li>
                Multiple jobs in these fields have given me lots of experience with many different facets of Cx, including in-depth Tech Support.
                <li>Outdoors</li>
                I was in the Boy Scouts for my childhood, and through my life have come to learn many skills involved with camping and hiking.
                <li>Information Sponge</li>
                Presenting as both a blessing and curse depending on the context; I have an exceptional memory, and, paired with my innate need to observe everything around me, this means that I'm basically just a dump for info. I consistently will jump into a rabbit hole on Wikipedia or other similar site and spend hours reading about obscure topics without realizing it.

            <h3>Interests</h3>
                <main>
                    <h4>Music</h4>
                    <p>Since I was a young kid, I've always been really into listening to music, I got a portable CD player for my 5th birthday and used it constantly, we even had to replace the laser at one point. Once I was older I was very interested in making music too, so through self-learning and trial and error, I learned how to use FL Studio (and other DAWs) to make music! Having this creative outlet is very helpful, and although I wouldn't call myself proficient at all, it's still fun to see work pay off.</p>
                    <h4>Video Games</h4>
                    <p>Also since a young age, I've loved video games. At as young as 4 years old, my Dad let me start playing the Nintendo 64, and the rest is history. Although I enjoy pretty much every style of game, I'm especially partial to RPGs, as most of my first (and still my favorite) games were the same. Final Fantasy, Paper Mario, Fire Emblem, etc. I do most of my gaming on my PC, but I also have a Switch and will use the PC for emulators too.</p>
                    <h4>Outdoors</h4>
                    <p>I started in the BSA at 8 years old, and credit it with bestowing me with my love for the outdoors. "The Great Outdoors" is my escape from the world, and many weekends year round I will most likely be off hiking or camping somewhere. I have lots of different gear to ensure that I'm prepared for any situation or weather that presents itself, and with all the years of scouting experience I've encountered most of those situations already anyway, and thus know how to react if they come again. (Hello, Yellowstone bear encounter!)</p>
                    <h4>Cars</h4>
                    <p>Thanks to some relatives who owned some exciting cars when I was a teenager, I developed a love for cars and their function not only as vehicles, but the engineering and mechanics behind the design of engines, bodies, etc. Of course, driving is pretty great too.</p>
                    <h4>Learning</h4>
                    <p>With a nearly insatiable curiosity and drive to learn new things anyway, I constantly try to find new things to learn about or learn more about things with which I'm already familiar. The variance and range of these subjects is pretty funny, I can go from reading about the function of natural nuclear reactors in Africa, to learning the steps of the process of municipal wastewater treatment, to reading about the details of an animal that went extinct 20 million years before I was born. It's great fun. </p>

        <div id="goals">
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>In the short term I obviously want to graduate from this DevMountain course, but as for the future, frankly I have no interest in making a career at all, my ideal future would involve creating something and selling it, either for enough passive income to "retire", or for a large enough lump sum to retire. Then I can spend my time doing things that actually feel fulfilling to me, such as art, travel, etc./p>
